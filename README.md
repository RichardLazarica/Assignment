# What I am most proud of in the assignment

Richard Lazarica: I am proud that I was able to create a music visualiser even though I'm not good at handling problems or projects that have or represents something graphical.

# What I learned

Richard Lazarica: I have learned about OOP and how to use them adequately with graphic library in order to represent frequencies visually. It helped refine my knowledge I previously had about OOP principles and learned how to create graphical animated objects from scratch.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
