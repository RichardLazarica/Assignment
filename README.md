# What I am most proud of in the assignment

Richard Lazarica: I am proud that I was able to create a music visualiser even though I'm not good at handling problems or projects that have or represents something graphical.

# What I learned

Richard Lazarica: I have learned about OOP and how to use them adequately with graphic library in order to represent frequencies visually. It helped refine my knowledge I previously had about OOP principles and learned how to create graphical animated objects from scratch.
